Infinispan Session Manager

  A HttpSession manager that replicates sessions in an Infinigrid Cache.
  This project currently supports Jetty 7.x and has been tested with
  Jetty 7.2.0.v20101020.

* Limitations

  All objects stored in the InfinigridHttpSession must be serializable
  and also have a no-arg constructor.

  HttpSessionAttributeListeners are not currently invoked.
