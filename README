ism - Infinispan Session Manager

  A Jetty SessionManager that replicates sessions in an Infinispan Cache. This
  provides an easy way to build a cluster of Jetty instances that share session
  state.

  This version supports Jetty 8.1.x and has been tested with
  Jetty 8.1.10.v20130312 and Infinispan 5.2.5.Final

  and also have a no-arg constructor.
