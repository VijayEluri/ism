Infinispan Session Manager

  A HttpSession manager that replicates sessions in an Infinispan Cache.
  This project currently supports Jetty 7.x and has been tested with
  Jetty 7.3.1.v20110307 and Infinispan 4.2.1.FINAL.

* Limitations

  All objects stored in the InfinispanHttpSession must be serializable
  and also have a no-arg constructor.

  HttpSessionAttributeListeners are not currently invoked.
